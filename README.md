# Steam-Password-Bruteforcer-C-

Hey guys,

This is an example of a password brutforecer for steam. (Somewhat secured, steam wont know you are a bot.)
This application is possible trying a shitload of logins a minute.
Only things you need are a good proxy list, this can be socks4/5 or HTTPS, and some good password comination.

Multithreading is implemented by default.

Take a look for youself.
